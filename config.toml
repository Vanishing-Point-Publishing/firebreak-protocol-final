  author_bio = "Doug Baker is an Advisory Software Architect based in Fort Collins, Colorado. A graduate of Colorado State University with a B.S. in Computer Science, he studied mathematics and physics extensively--a foundation that grounds his fiction in hard science. Doug doesn't just write about AI; he works with it daily, leveraging tools like Microsoft Copilot, Gemini, and Claude Sonnet to push the boundaries of software development. He uses this blend of theoretical physics and hands-on AI expertise to write technothrillers that feel less like fiction and more like future history."
